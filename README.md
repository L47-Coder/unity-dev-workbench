This repository hosts the source of the **Dev Workbench** Unity package
(`com.l47coder.dev-workbench`) together with a minimal Unity host project that
is used for developing and dogfooding the package.

- **Package source** — [`Packages/com.l47coder.dev-workbench/`](./Packages/com.l47coder.dev-workbench)
- **Package README** — [`Packages/com.l47coder.dev-workbench/README.md`](./Packages/com.l47coder.dev-workbench/README.md)
- **Changelog** — [`CHANGELOG.md`](./Packages/com.l47coder.dev-workbench/CHANGELOG.md)
- **License** — [MIT](./LICENSE)

Dev Workbench is a Unity **Manager / Component** framework powered by
`ScriptableObject` + `Addressables`, shipped with an in-editor **DevWorkbench**
panel (`Tools → Dev Workbench`) that provides one-click creation and visual
management of Managers, Components, Addressable groups and the framework-wide
Sync step.

Because the package is kept as an **embedded** package (not a git submodule),
cloning this repository and opening it in Unity gives you a working editor
install — any change you make under `Packages/com.l47coder.dev-workbench/` is
picked up live.

## Install the package in your own project

Open `Window → Package Manager`, click `+ → Add package from git URL…` and
paste:

```
https://github.com/L47-Coder/unity-dev-workbench.git?path=Packages/com.l47coder.dev-workbench
```

Or edit your project's `Packages/manifest.json` directly:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.l47coder.dev-workbench": "https://github.com/L47-Coder/unity-dev-workbench.git?path=Packages/com.l47coder.dev-workbench"
  }
}
```

The `?path=` segment is required because this repository is an entire Unity
project — without it, UPM would try to treat the repo root as the package.

See the package README for full usage details, quick-start and host-project
layout conventions.

## Requirements

- Unity **2022.3 LTS** or newer (developed against `2022.3.60f1`)
- UPM dependencies resolved automatically by `package.json`:
  - `com.unity.addressables` 1.23.1
  - `com.cysharp.unitask` 2.5.10
  - `jp.hadashikick.vcontainer` 1.17.0

## Development

Clone and open the repository as a regular Unity project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/L47-Coder/unity-dev-workbench.git
```

Then open the folder in **Unity 2022.3 LTS**. The embedded package is live —
edit `Packages/com.l47coder.dev-workbench/…` and Unity will recompile.
